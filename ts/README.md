## Golem DB SDK example for TypeScript

This example presents how to do CRUD operations onto Golem DB.
In order to run it we recommend `bun` (visit https://bun.sh) as it has
native TS support and interpret it without any overhead:

1. Install GolemDB SDK and other dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

or

```bash
bun add golem-base-sdk tslib crypto @types/node
```

2. Run crud.ts script:

```bash
bun run crud.ts
```
